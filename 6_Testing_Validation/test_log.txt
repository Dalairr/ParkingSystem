TEST STARTED: Simulating Parking Spot Trigger

Serial port opened: /dev/ttyUSB0
Raw input received: '2,0'

Parsed spot_id = '2', raw_state = '0' → mapped to status = 'O' (Available)
MQTT Published: {'spot_id': '2', 'status': 'O', 'timestamp': 1747783901}
DynamoDB Updated for spot 2 with payload:
    {
        "spot_id": "2",
        "status": "O",
        "timestamp": 1747783901
    }

Waiting 10 seconds for system sync...

Lambda GET triggered:
    → Returned JSON:
    [
        {
            "spot": "2",
            "status": "O"
        }
    ]

Frontend UI updated:
     	Spot 2 displayed as available
	All grid cells rendered in correct layout

SYSTEM BEHAVIOR CONFIRMED:
    - End-to-end data transmission successful
    - MQTT and DynamoDB pipeline working
    - Lambda properly filters latest record
    - Frontend synced and auto-refreshed UI

TEST COMPLETE: Functional requirement passed
